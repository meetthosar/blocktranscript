# Block Transcript

Apart from teaching and conducting exams, universities have another important function - offering transcripts. Getting a transcript is a long process. I intend to put it on the blockchain so that it becomes easy to request and authenticate the student's performance through the digital transcript.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
